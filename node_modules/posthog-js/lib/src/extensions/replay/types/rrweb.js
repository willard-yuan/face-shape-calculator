// This file is supposed to replicate some of the types hidden inside `@rrweb/record`
// to guarantee that our users can use this library - and validate types - without
// having to install `@rrweb/record`
//
// They might still need to install `@rrweb/types` to use this file,
// but that's a much lighter library.
//
// NOTE: This file should be updated and kept in sync with `@rrweb/record` if we ever update it.
// NOTEÂ²: The initial types are not exported, we're only exporting the two types at the bottom.
//        They're only here to allow the bottom types to be more easily defined.
