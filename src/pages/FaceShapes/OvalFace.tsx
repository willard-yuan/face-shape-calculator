            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
              <li>Face length is approximately 1.5 times the width</li>

              <li>Cheekbones are the widest part of the face</li>

              Oval faces are fortunate to suit almost any hairstyle, but these
              are particularly flattering:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
              <li>Long, layered cuts that frame the face</li>
              <li>Medium-length bobs with or without bangs</li>
              <li>Pixie cuts that showcase the features</li>
              <li>Side or center parts both work well</li>
              <li>Styles that maintain the natural balance of the face</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While most styles work well, avoid excessively bulky styles that
              might overwhelm your natural features.
