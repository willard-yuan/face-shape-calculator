              The diamond face shape has distinct angular features with dramatic
              proportions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
              <li>Prominent, high cheekbones as the widest part of the face</li>
              <li>Narrow forehead that's not as wide as the cheekbones</li>
              <li>Narrow, sometimes pointed chin</li>
              <li>Angular jawline that tapers to the chin</li>
              <li>Face length is typically longer than width</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Diamond faces are characterized by their distinctive bone
              structure and dramatic angles, creating a naturally sculpted
              appearance.

              Ideal hairstyles for diamond faces soften the angles and create
              balance:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
              <li>Side-swept bangs or wispy fringe to soften the forehead</li>
              <li>
                Styles with volume at the temples to balance narrow forehead
              </li>
              <li>Chin-length or longer cuts that soften the jawline</li>
              <li>Layers around the face that soften angular features</li>
              <li>
                Styles with fullness at the jawline to balance the cheekbones
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Avoid styles that are too sleek or pulled back, which can
              emphasize angular features.
