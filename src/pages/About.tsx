              We use MediaPipe's face mesh detection system to identify 468
              facial landmarks. These landmarks help us accurately measure key
              facial dimensions:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-gray-700">
              <li>Face length (forehead to chin)</li>
              <li>Face width (cheek to cheek)</li>
              <li>Jawline width and angle</li>

            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              By analyzing these measurements, our algorithm determines which of
              the six common face shapes your features most closely match.
